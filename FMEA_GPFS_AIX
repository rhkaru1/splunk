Failure Mode,Potential Cause,Impact (Severity),Mitigation / Prevention
Python 3 Dependency Failure,AIX 7.2 lacks Python 3 by default; GPFS 5.1+ management commands require it.,High: mm commands fail; GUI and monitoring won't start.,Pre-install Python 3.8+ via AIX Toolbox for Linux. Ensure /usr/bin/python3 is symlinked correctly.
Kernel Extension Unload Failure,Files or processes are pinning GPFS kernel extensions (mmfsenv -u fails).,Medium: Requires a node reboot to complete the upgrade.,"Run mmfsenv -u. If it fails, identify pinning processes or schedule a reboot as part of the upgrade step for that node."
Incompatible AIX TL/SP,Target GPFS 5.2 version requires a higher AIX Technology Level than currently installed.,High: Filesets fail to install or daemon fails to start.,"Verify compatibility in the IBM Storage Scale FAQ. Ensure AIX 7.2 is at the recommended TL (e.g., TL5)."
Rollback Capability Loss,Filesystem version (mmchfs -V) is upgraded before all nodes are stable.,Critical: Impossible to revert to 5.0 software without restore from backup.,Mitigation: Use alt_disk_copy to clone rootvg before starting. Prevention: Do not run mmchfs -V until 1 week of stable operation on 5.2.
GSKit/Security Mismatch,New gpfs.gskit filesets conflict with existing AIX security libraries.,Medium: CCR (Cluster Configuration Repository) communication fails.,Always upgrade GSKit filesets alongside GPFS. Ensure gpfs.gskit and gpfs.base are from the same release package.
Quorum Loss (AIX LPAR),Simultaneous upgrade of LPARs residing on the same physical Power server (managed by the same HMC).,Critical: Cluster-wide outage due to loss of majority.,Ensure Quorum nodes are distributed across different physical Power frames (CEC).
